ActiveRecord is a thing

BILL HIXS comedian

require 'models/users.rb'

class User

def new
def find
def update
delete

RUBY MONKEY PATCHING

class DataMapper <-- its a design pattern that constructs sql for me
def find
	config --> "SELECT * from users"

User < DataMapper
def config 
	{table name: users}
end

DATAMAPPER
concept of raw and modified
@raw - "storeing whats coming out of database" what comes out of database {id:6, name:"foo"}
@modified - "storeing the dirty state of what is to be saved"
			 what comes in from user (sometimes called dirty) {}

user.id //returns 6

DIRTY STATE
there is some magic that is the solution to not needing get/set methods
lets call it: 
def magic_get(k)
	if method_exists()
		
		return k
	return @modified[k] || row[k];
	
end

def magic_set(k, v)
	@modified[k] = v;
end

SAVEING
def save
	@modified.each
	
do a ruby merge to commit @modified to @raw

with string interpolation this is creating sql code (could validate too)

Lets say when i output a name I want it upper case:
OR Unix timestamp converted to a friendly looking timestamp


	
def get_name
	return name.capitalize
end

AND THEN do set		

____

User < DataMapper

	def validate_name
		if name.match/[^A-Za-z]/ OR /\W/
			return false or "cannot contain letters"
